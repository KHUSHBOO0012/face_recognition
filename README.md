# face_recognition
Here is my face recognition project from scratch.I have done it in association with Mukul Ranjan(fellow at IIT guwahati).one can 
understand about it by reading my "celebrity face_recognition using pretrained inception block and facenet model.ipynb" notebook.
here i have made it only for two celebrity for knowledge point of view but you can make it work for even 100 or thousands person
just by making their dataset too.
